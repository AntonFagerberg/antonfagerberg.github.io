			<h1>Checkpoint</h1>
			<p><p>Checkpoint was written for Pan Nordic Logistics to help them achieve a new security classification which included that no drivers where allowed inside the terminal area. Checkpoint scheduled the incoming linehauls and communicated with third party systems to unlock doors, manage traffic lights and send real-time information to the drivers PDAs. Checkpoint also featured a touch-screen interface used on truck-mounted PC’s inside the terminal area.</p>

			<h1>RK</h1>
			<p><p>This first version of RK was written back in 2005 to help Pan Nordic Logistics track, manage and generate statistics &amp; financial data about the parcels sent back in return from customers. It is a web application written in PHP with a MySQL database and it is still used today serving information about nearly two million parcels.</p>
