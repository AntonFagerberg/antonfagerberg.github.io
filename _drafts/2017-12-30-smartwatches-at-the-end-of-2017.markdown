### Or why did I buy a Pebble at its end of life?

I've never really wanted a smartwatch before. I felt that they are mostly for 
notifications (which I generally dislike) and let's you do mobile phone things
but with a clunky user experience.

But over Christmas, I found a [Pebble Time Round](https://www.pebble.com/pebble-time-round-smartwatch-features)
on sale for about 1400 SEK ($170 / â‚¬140) which less than half the price of most
other smartwatches on the market right now.

There is a big catch. Pebble is essentially no more and all services will
shut down any day now. Good thing is that everything will (hopefully) [still work](https://developer.pebble.com/blog/2017/04/04/transitioning-update/), 
as long as you (or the Pebble community) do some work yourself. The biggest problem
is that the official "app store" will be gone. I can live with that, I mainly
want the watches built in functionality and I already have the watch faces I need -
and I'm willing to try to develop my own.

In my mind there are mainly three other watches I would consider. The [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/se/watch/),
[Samsung Gear S3 (Classic / Frontier)](http://www.samsung.com/se/wearables/gear-s3/) 
or a [Kronaby](https://www.kronaby.com).

I've been an iPhone user for many years so that limits the options and you would
think the Apple Watch be a no brainer. It's the only smartwatch I've
seen people actually use. But there are two things I dislike with it. First,
the display is black (off) most of the time. Second, I don't like that it's square (and
it's pretty thick). The Pebble Time Round is super thin and the display is always
on.

The Samsung Gear S3 (Classic / Frontier) seems to do this better. It has the option
to enable always on display and it is round. It is a huge beast compared to the 
Pebble though. This is good and bad, for me it's a matter of visual taste. I was
very tempted to buy this thing but the iPhone experience with it is so degraded
compared to if you have a Samsung / Android phone. If I did own an Android phone, and I may
go that route for my next phone, then I'll definitely consider this (or whatever
similar product is available in the future).

The Kronaby looks like a normal watch (there are similar watches like [Skagen Connected](http://www.skagen.com/us/en/lp/wearables.html) - 
I'm a big fan of Skagen's regular watches). Thought it looks very good (it looks
like any regular good-looking analog watch), the lack of display limits the 
functionality greatly. Interesting approach, not sure if it's a good idea or not.
If you want do want a regular analog watch, why not get this with some extra 
tech inside it?

In the end, after having had some issues with the Pebble (requiring a factory
reset and re-installing the iPhone app for the bluetooth to be stable), it now
works great. Below is the features the Pebble has which I love and what I want
my next smartwatch to have as well.

#### Must-have features
- **Vibrating alarm** great for waking me up but no-one else in the room
- **Smart wake-up** waking you up in the best sleep cycle - not sure how good this works yet
- **Step counter** as they say, no exercise measurement is accurate but it helps to measure just about anything anyway (placebo?)
- **Sleep tracker** since I'm a father of a new born baby and sleep is now a luxury, this is suddenly interesting
- **Custom watch faces** sometimes you want a lot of info, sometimes minimalistic, and perhaps one day you want Super Mario or Mickey Mouse
- **Notifications** thought I would hate it but it's actually nice not having to pick up the phone to check why it beeped
- **Always on display** because it's practical and looks good (eInk is good for this, no distractions at night and works in sunlight)
- **Developer friendly** so I can write my own apps and watch faces
- **Calendar** reminders and what's up next is neat
- **Reminders** because I forget everything
- **Good design** I want to wear something that looks good

#### Don't really care (yet)
- **Weather** looks nice but I don't really care that much
- **Touchscreen** no must have, good analog controls feels more imporant
- **Calling** not gonna talk to my wrist (reject calls with a predefined message could be good tough)
- **Sms reply** feels clunky but perhaps predefined messages could be good (not sure)
- **GPS** not for me, good if you exercise outside though
- **Music control** I do this from my car / headset / computer
