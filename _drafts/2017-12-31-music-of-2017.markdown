According to Spotify, I listened to 29,288 minutes of music in 2017 (December 
excluded). Here are some of the highlights!

# Top 3 Best Albums

## Kamasi Washington - Harmony of Difference

I've started listening to a lot of Jazz and Kamasi is one of the few modern artists
I've discovered. I've listened to a lot of other artists he seem to be around: 
Thundercat, Flying Lotus, Kendrick Lamar.

I got the single Truth first and later the full album Harmony of Difference and 
I've been playing it so many times. It never gets old!

## Thundercat - Drunk

Big fan of Thundercat! Got the latest album Drunk on vinyl at the legendary Amoeba 
when I was over working in the US. So much good stuff on it. He is my absolute 
favourite artist.

## Kota the Friend - Paloma Beach
Kota the Friend quickly became on of my favourite hip-hop artists. It's chill,
positive and feels real. We need more of that.

# Bonus things

Here are some things which are not albums or older than 2017 but which I discovered this year.

### BINKBEATS ft. Niels Broos - Little Nerves

Found this randomly on YouTube and it's almost magically good. Don't know what to
say, it's so many interesting sounds and it shows so much talent in the video.

### Shawn Wasabi - Otter pop

I found Shawn Wasabi via the [midi fighter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRH1VwBjeGI) 
and the single Otterpop is too catchy not to love and play on repeat. Perfect
as a pick-me-up song.

### Ali Farka Touré & Toumani Diabaté - Ali & Toumani

Not sure how I found the album (it's from 2009 but I found it this year) Ali & 
Toumani but oh man, that was a pot of gold. It's so damn good, I've probably 
listened to it 100 times and I can listen to it again any time!

### The Fresh Prince of Hydrocity Zone

A goof more than anything else but damn, Sonic had some REALLY good music.
