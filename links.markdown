This is my collection of links to things I like. Blog posts, people, artists, music, coffee and other things. 
I started this in 2024 and will expand it as I go along. 
My intention is to have a "high bar" for what I add here so it'll be few but really good things.


## Programming
- [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev) (very good tips for developers)

## Coffee
- [Muttley & Jacks](https://muttleyandjacks.se) (my favorite coffee roastery in Sweden)
- [Gringo Nordic](https://www.gringonordic.se) (also a good coffee roastery in Sweden)

## Music
- [Svaneborg Kardyb](https://svaneborgkardyb.com) (fantastic jazz duo from Denmark)
- [Tycho](https://tychomusic.com) (very good electronic artist)
