I should probably feel ashamed of not knowing this name before. Joe Walsh has been a member of many well-known rock bands: James Gang, Barnstorm, Eagles, The Party Boys, and Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. Joe Walsh has also been placed at number 54 on Rolling Stone magazine's "100 Greatest Guitarist of All Time".

This record was released in 1978 and is a solid rock album with many great tracks. The last song on the album, "Life's Been Good" is a satirical song about being a rock star and it became Joe's biggest solo hit. This record contains the original 8 minute version while the single release was cut down to 4Â½ minutes.

As a final note, I really dig the album art featuring an under water picnic shot in a pool. To tie it all together, the sleeve looks like the table cloth.
