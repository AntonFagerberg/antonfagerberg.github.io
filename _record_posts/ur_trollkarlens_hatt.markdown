Continuing with another Bo Hansson record. This is his second record and it sounds somewhat similar to Sagan om Ringen (Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings); supposedly it contains some martial which didn't fit on the first record (one track is named Fylke which is the Swedish translation of The Shire).

The songs are fantasy inspired as in his previous record. One of the tracks is apparently named after the book [Elidor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elidor) - I have to read it some day to see what it's all about.

I think the music on this record is a bit more varied compared to Sagan om Ringen and perhaps because of this not as coherent. That's not necessarily something negative, I think it is an excellent record, more complex and perhaps at times even better than Sagan om Ringen.
