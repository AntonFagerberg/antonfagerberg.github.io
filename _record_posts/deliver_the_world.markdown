This is a really funky, sexy album. The line-up of War seem to have changed many times, 39 members all in all, with Leroy "Lonnie" Jordan as the only original member in the current line-up (still playing 47 years after the band was formed at the time of writing). Four of the five (living) original members branched out and kept playing together but lost (in federal court) the right to use the name War and are therefore playing under under the name Lowrider Band.

Deliver The World was the sixth album and it was released in 1973. The cover has a teared window in the corner which reveals someone walking on a beach while the other side is a blue version of the same image.

 War was also known for transcending racial and cultural barriers with a multi-ethnic line-up.
