I've been listening to this record a lot and it is really, really great. I believe that it is the first, and one of Bo Hansson's most famous albums. According to Wikipedia, Bo Hansson's girlfriend told him to read the Lord of the Rings books, and after doing so, Bo thought that the books needed a soundtrack. He created the music over a period of three months in an apartment which he'd borrowed from a friend (which upon returning home found out that he'd been evicted due to noise complaints from the neighbors).

It's interesting to hear just how different this soundtrack is compared to the Lord of the Rings movie soundtrack and imagine how the movies could be so much different as well.

The typical Bo Hansson sound is due to the [Hammond organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ), and instrument he got inspired to use after seeing to the American jazz organist Jack McDuff. Bo appears to have been a very private person who didn't like to play much in front of an audience - but in terms of records, I know that he will return as I make my was further through the record collection.
