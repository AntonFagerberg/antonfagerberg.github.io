Part 3 in the "Old Man's War" series. The main protagonist is back but the setting of the book is yet again different than the previous ones. It's a good book but I don't think it tops the first one.

There are several more books in the series but I think this will be the last one for me. The books all have good endings so I don't feel like I'm missing anything by stopping now (no cliffhangers).

A really good series so far but I'd rather continue with something new at this point.
