I've viewed quite a lot of Myth Busters and Adam seems like a genuinely good & funny guy. 
His YouTube channel seems like a good place if you're generally into nerdy things.

This book mixes a few stories from his life and work history but the larger portion is more about tips for _makers_.
It's a good book but probably much more interesting if you're a _maker_ yourself---I wasn't
super thrilled when I read the chapters about todo-lists or different glues.
