This is one of those book which feels like a Hollywood action movie - and that was
exactly what I wanted. It's action packed, high paced and the story is 
captivating.

It's not a fantastic work of art which leaves a deep impression but it is a good
book which I really enjoyed reading and would recommend to those who are looking
for that kind of a book.
