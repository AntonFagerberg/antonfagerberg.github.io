This is the second book I've read by Kazuo Ishiguro - I wanted to read something with "quality", whatever that means, and he has gotten the Nobel prize in literature after all.

The premise is interesting and dramatic but it never reads as particularly dramatic.
The writing makes it feel super realistic, to the point that it feels strange that it's not real. 

But this books was not a favorite of mine. 
It's not boring but reading it felt a bit slow and unexciting.
Not bad but not a book for me.
