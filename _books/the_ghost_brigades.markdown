I loved Old Man's War so I was eager to pick up this sequel - but I have to admit
that I was a bit disappointed at first. The first book had a protagonist that
I really liked and the world was discovered through his eyes. This book
on the other hand is not about the same person and is much more "story universe expanding".

In the end though, this is also a really good book (even if not as good as the first one).
It has a lot of interesting ideas and I'm still eager to continue with book #3.
