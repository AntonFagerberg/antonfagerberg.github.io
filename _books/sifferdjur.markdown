A Swedish book about numbers and how they affect us. It's a mix of interesting scientific studies, funny anecdotes and criticism about the way we live today.
It's about how numbers affect our feelings and thoughts, our desire to measure ourselves and everything, how measurements can corrupt things and how algorithms from big tech takes advantage of our numbers.

The tone is light hearted but I think you can read this book as either a funny book or a serious one depending on how you see it.
