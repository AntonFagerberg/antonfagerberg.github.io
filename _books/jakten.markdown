This book is about an anonymous Swedish female(?) hacker who dedicated years of her life to hacking and tracking down a pedophile in Norway (among other things).

It's also an intimiate look into someone who gets obsessed to the point when it's not healthy anymore, in combination with with various preposed mental illness issues, a childhood filled with bullying and being outside.

An interesting, intimate story.
