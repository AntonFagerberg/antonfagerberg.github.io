Having worked in software development with Scrum-like processes, I thought it was time to read about it from the inventor. This book isn't a educational textbook but a history where things came from and why.

Over all, it's a good read with solid sound ideas. My main criticism is that it at times seems too good to be true, like it's the phenomenal cure to all problems, not only in software development but poverty in Africa and much more.
