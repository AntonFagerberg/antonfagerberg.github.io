Swedish book about the space race, from the German V2 rocket during World War II up to recent events with Chinas space station and the war in Ukraine - though focus is more on history and the "classical space race".

I really liked this book! It's super interesting and well written. Short and sweet, always on point. I learned a lot and I highly recommend this book for everyone.
