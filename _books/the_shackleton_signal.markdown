I've got mixed feelings about this book. As a "hard sci-fi" it felt pretty dry at the beginning with a lot of technical details that didn't really help the story. About half way in it started getting really interesting but towards the end it started fumbling. After finishing it, I think it's an OK book. It's a bit like a Hollywood thriller in book form. Entertaining, not great.

Andy Weir's books (like "the martian") are better if you're in the mood for something similar.
