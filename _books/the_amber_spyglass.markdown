I struggled finishing this book. 
I really wanted to like it but it was so hard to finish. To be honest, it wasn't a good book.

It really is a shame. The first book in this trilogy was excellent and the second was ok.
While this final book had some good parts, there were just too many bad things.

The weird Christianity-thing, the shift away from Lyra and how she was in the first book - and the main story plot in general, the "epic finale" build up. Stop after book one.
