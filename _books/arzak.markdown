Picked this one up on a whim at the local library along with some other graphical novels.
I'm not really sure what to say about it. The artwork is absolutely fantastic, it can be my absolute favorite.

The general feeling is also ok but it doesn't really do much for me story wise, and I generally feel this way about most graphical novels unfortunately.

I really want to like it but I don't get hooked. The pictures though are enough of a reason to pick it up and look through it at least.
