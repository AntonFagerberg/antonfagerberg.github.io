I don't know what to make of this book. The closest analogy I can think of is that it's something like a Chinese version Haruki Murakami. It's a kinda nice read, I like the writing style and at times it is interesting. There's a lot of Chinese details in the story that's fun to hear about.

Overall though, it seems a bit pointless - like nothing really mattered. Either you love'll the "feeling" of the book, or you'll just find it weird.

> But that is the charm of childhood, isnâ€™t it? We remember it as being either filled with bliss or filled with pain, and as we grow up, we begin living every day in between.
