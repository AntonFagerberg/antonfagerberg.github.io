I searched for "feel good fantasy" and found this book - it really delivered! 
I've seen the Ghibli-movie before but didn't think much of it, this book however
was so so good (I must see the movie again now that I've read the book).

The book was exactly what I was looking for and I enjoyed every second of it.
It's a book I want in my shelf, recommend to friends and I read to my kids one day.
This book should be considered a classic.
