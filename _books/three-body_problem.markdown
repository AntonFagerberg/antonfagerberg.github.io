This is a really great science-fiction book, one of the best I've read in a long time. I like the mix of real science and engineering concepts mixed with, you guessed it, fictional science.

It's the first book in a trilogy, though I'm rarely a fan of book series, it may be good one in this case. Also fun to read something of a Chinese author.
