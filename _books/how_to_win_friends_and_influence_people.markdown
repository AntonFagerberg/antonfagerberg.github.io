The title is a bit off-putting for me, but it's been referenced so many times that
I finally had to read it. The first print was 85 years, and aside
from a few contextual things it feels surprisingly contemporary.

The content though is a bit meh. It's essentialy making other people happy so they'll
do what you want them to. A lot of it is pretty basic: smile,
let people talk about themselves, view problems from their angle.

It's a bit icky in a salesman kind of way, and many of the
anecdotes seems like hyperbole BS. A couple of decent good ideas nonetheless.
