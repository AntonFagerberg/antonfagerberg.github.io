On to the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Much of what I said about The Fellowship of the Ring holds true for this book as well. It's more of the same and it's really good.

It does feel a little bit like a "middle in a trilogy"-book, but overall a lot of good stuff. I think the first book is a bit better, I found the arch with Frodo, Sam and Gollum a bit annoying at times (bot Sam and Gollum can be a bit tedious). Looking forward to starting the final book soon!
