A book about the difficulties of being a parent, or having a child together with a partner who is 'highly sensitive' / have sensory processing sensitivity.

It's a pretty decent book, overall the conclusion seems to be that it's really difficult. One problem with the book is that some tips are only applicable for certain countries, like having a nanny. The key takeaways seem to be to get a lot of help and not have many children.
