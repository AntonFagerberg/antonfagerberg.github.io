A real-life story about nursing and kindness told as stories taking place over the career of a nurse, from very young to experienced. It is interesting, educational, funny, heart breaking and a roller-coaster to read.

I haven't read anything like it but it was well worth reading. It's a humbling and thought provoking book that should fit almost everyone.
