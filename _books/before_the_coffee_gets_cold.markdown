Another Japanese book - a surprisingly good one! It manages to bring a new twist to a time travel story (which can both be complex and feel somewhat worn out at this point). But while feeling a bit light hearted starting out, it has a lot of storytelling depth.

This book tells a bunch of separate stories but with reoccurring characters found in a mysterious caf√©. Many of the stories are surprisingly touching with emotionally loaded topics. It say a lot in not too many pages. I really like that with Japanese books.
