This was a random pick from the local library, and the first Swedish sci-fi I've read.
First of all, this book is extremely "on the nose". It lacks a lot of finesse and nuance, but they main storyline is good and it's fun that Sweden is in focus (somewhat at least).

The main theme is environmental disaster, the problems with humanity, capitalism, exploitation and our societies.
I enjoyed reading it. It's good but not great. Could probably be reworked into being something great.
