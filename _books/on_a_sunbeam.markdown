I read this online several years ago (which you can do for free on Tillie Walden's homepage) but now I picked up the book and read through all of it during two slow mornings while on my summer vacation. There's a lot to be liked in the graphic novel. The drawings are really nice, the setting and characters are great, a good storyline and there's a sci-fi aesthetic that feels out of the ordinary that I really like (fish-like ships!). This one is a favorite for me, perhaps even a masterpiece! For sure the best graphic novel I've read so far in my life.
