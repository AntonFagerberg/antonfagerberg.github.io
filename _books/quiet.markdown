Quiet is a book about introversion (and extroversion but mainly focused on introversion because that's needed). As an introvert myself I've read some about this topic but this book took it to a whole new level. It's very thorough, covers fascinating historical aspects, a lot of personal anecdotes but always tries to tie it to scientific research. 

I really, really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to everyone, introverts and extroverts alike, and especially parents because it can teach everyone more about how we humans function differently.
