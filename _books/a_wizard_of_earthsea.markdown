I've been meaning to read this for a long time and finally got around to it. I'm not sure what I think about it. The writing is warm and inviting, something I really liked. The world feels interesting but overall the story didn't really grip me in a "page turner" way. 

It's interesting in parts but as a whole I wasn't super gripped by it and I'm not eager to pick up any of the other Earthsea books.
