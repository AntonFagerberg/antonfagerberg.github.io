I regret finishing this book. While I do agree
with much from the minimalism movement, this book is in many ways a 
representation of all that is bad about it.

There are a few ideas, but mostly it feels like populism, or
like a conspiracy theory in which the author goes backwards from result to cause.
It's bad, stay away.
