The story about how Windows NT got created which laid the foundation for all modern version of Windows.
Not a Microsoft / Windows fan at all myself but this started out pretty interesting, learned a few things along the way.

Much of the book though is about egomaniac programmers working until burnout, wrecking their marriages and missing out on their children growing up along the way. The book also suffers a bit from trying to explain complex programming subjects for people with no experience with programming.
