An autobiography of a girl growing up in a deeply religious survivalist home by
parents that doesn't know how old she is or when her birthday is.

I got sucked into this book right away and couldn't put it down. Full of pain 
and misery but also full of hope. Every chapter is a well written piece of her 
complex life. Highly recommended.
