A friend recommended this book and pitched it as the author has written the story that
inspired the film Arrival (which I really like). The book itself is several
short stories that stand on their own.

As a book it's a mixed bag. Some of the stories are among the best I've ever 
read, but others I found downright boring and uninteresting. Nonetheless, it's
a book that's definitely worth picking up for the good ones!
