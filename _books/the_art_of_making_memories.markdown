This bok is written by Meik Wiking who is the CEO of The Happiness Research Institute - how great is that? The book is, as the title suggests, about (mainly happy) memories, how to make more of them, make 'em stick and why it matters.

I really liked this book. The writing style is witty but on point. It's practical, theoretical and very interesting. It's a highly recommended read that I will likely re-read many times.
