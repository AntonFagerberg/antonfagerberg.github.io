I had to buy this book after watching, and re-watching, the Netflix series with the same name (a long with other videos featuring Samin Nosrat). It's a superb book, one part 'educational', one part recipes.

I haven't cooked any recipes yet but the 'educational' part is great and it's one of those books you have to read, re-read, look up and try things out. Highly recommended! (And the hardcover version featured in the image is beautiful!)
