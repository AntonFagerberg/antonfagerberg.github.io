Continuing my haul of Japanese books. This is definitely a little more on the quirky and light-hearted side. A couple of different stories revolving around patients who visit a strange mental health clinic that prescribes cats (the book is in a sense a love letter to cats, I think). 

The first story was really good and I wished it would've continued for the remainder of the book. The other ones were a mixed bag that loosely ties together towards the end.

Not the best book I've read but a decent read.
