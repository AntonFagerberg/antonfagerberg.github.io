This is a short read and can probably be considered a primer to feminism. It's the first feminist literature that I've read and I found it well argued, on point and very relevant. This should be a no brainer for everyone to read and would serve well as being part of our educational curriculum.

You can also [watch the TedTalk](http://ed.ted.com/on/WwTf6rSB) presented by the auther herself - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. I believe this TedTalk is pretty much identical to the book content.
