This is the squel to Wool (which I read in March, 2020). I actually read Wool a second time just before this one after having seen the new Silo series on Apple TV+ to refresh my memory.
Shift is not really a sequal but a prequel / side story that explains a lot of the loose ends from the first book.

The characters and scope of the book is different but the writing is the same; it hooks you in and makes it very hard to put the book down.
If you liked Wool and wanted more, you will like this one. I will continue with the final part in the trilogy soon.
