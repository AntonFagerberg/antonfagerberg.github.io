I'm by no means an F1 fan but I was, like many others, introduced to it by the Netflix series "Drive to survive" (which I've seen all seasons of since).

Guenther has of course been a favorite since the start and so I kinda picked this one up as a joke, but it's actually a really nice book.
It's mix of a diary over a year mixed in with some anecdotes and thoughts.

My respect for Guenther has grown a lot by reading this book. I do feel sorry for him with regards to how Haas F1 worked out.
