I've started reading a lot of psychology / self-help books over the years but I rarely finish any of them. This one on the other hand was interesting.

The main difference to other books I've read is that it's for / about people who are highly sensitive but also powerful / driven. People who can conqueror the world, tough as nails one day but can't get out of bed the next, crushed by emotions. (Exaggerated.)

I'm not sure if it's effective as a self-help book but the idea is interesting nonetheless.
