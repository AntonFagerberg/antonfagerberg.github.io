Truly one of the classics in software development. It has some clues which reveals its age, such as the mentioning of 640x480 screen resolution is, but it still feels timeless and relevant.

This is one of those books every programmer really should read at least once. It's filled with good tips, both in terms of technology but also regarding human behavior.

Whatever background you have, whether you're experienced or a beginner, if you haven't read this book yet you really should!
