I've read a few books by John Scalzi at this point. 
I really liked the "Old man's war"-series (read three of them so far I think) and The Kaiju preservation society was pretty good as well.

This book on the other hand wasn't a favorite. It's not bad, but it's not great either. It's just alright.
It started good but it I kinda lost interest along the way.
Like it should've been something more.

A bit preachy in regards to the authors opinions at times (even though I generally agree).
