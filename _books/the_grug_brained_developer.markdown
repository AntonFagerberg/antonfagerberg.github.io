Turning this into a book is a bit of a stretch. It's [this article](https://grugbrain.dev) in a tiny pamphlet sized book with a huge font (but still very few pages). Nonetheless, the content of this book is gold and it's a must read for any developer - experienced or novice. Every member of my team should have this as a required read.

It's a quick read so buying this in book form makes little sense but since I really like the article I felt it was a nice gesture to pay some money for it. It is also a nice reminder to see it in my book shelf. However you wish to consume it, it's a highly recommended!
