I suppose enough time has passed that I can tolerate reading a bit about Trump.
This is a well written book which covers many of the critical points of Trump's presidency such as The Mueller report, North Korea, George Floyd / BLM, Covid.

The book may make you understand Trump a bit more, but I think I can safely say
that the author is not pro Trump.
