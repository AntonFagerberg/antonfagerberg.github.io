This is some top-shelf, A-grade science fiction! 
I enjoyed this from the very start to the end.

The basic theme is space exploration, AI and humanity.
It's light hearted but also feels rooted in an appreciation to make it all seem realistic.
A bit like the Andy Weir's books.

It's part of a series (which I'm usually skeptical towards but I guess I have to concede those feelings).
I will not continue with book 2 immediately but very soon.

All in all, this turned out to be one of my favorite books ever.
