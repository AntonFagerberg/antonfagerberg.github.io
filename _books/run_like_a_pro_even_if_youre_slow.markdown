I've been getting into running lately for the first time in my life and decided that it would make sense to read at least one book about some theory and technique.

I'm not good at running and I don't really have any other books to compare with, but I think it was a good book. The theory made sense to me and many important aspects was covered (technique, rest, food, injuries, scientific studies, etc...). The pro-focus can be a bit off-putting at times.
