This is a hard one to review. I absolutely loved the first book of the "bobiverse" (this being book #2).
But I'm generally not a big fan of book series as I've said many times before.
I think it's because it feels like the author don't have to cut anything, they can explore everything since it doesn't need to fit into one book.

This book is a direct continuation of the first one. 
There are new things that makes it feel fresh.
While it is as good as the first book, it is exactly the same thing so some of that wow-factor is gone.
