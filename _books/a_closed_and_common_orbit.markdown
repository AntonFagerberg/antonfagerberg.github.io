This is the second part in the Wayfarers-series, the follow up to "The Long Way
to a Small, Angry Planet". While it is a partial continuation of the first book it's more or
less a stand-alone story.

This book is very different from the first one. The setting, mood and how
the story is built is a whole new thing. It's good but it wasn't really what I
was expected, or perhaps wanted. Many seem to like it more but I preferred the first
book. I'll take a break from the series now.
