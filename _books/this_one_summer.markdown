A picked this one up from the local library; I remembered it had been popping up on my social media feeds many years ago when I still used that.

It's a graphical novel and the drawings are beautiful.
The story on the other hand wasn't a favorite.
On one hand, perhaps I'm not the target audience.
I'm not sure but it feels a bit more targeted towards younger people.

But also, I don't think "family / relationship / teenage drama" is something that I enjoy reading about.
It's a "pass" for me.
