I didn't know much about Alex Schulman but I knew he has a popular podcast (never listened to it).
Not sure why I picked up this book, it's not a book I would've guessed that I 
would read but it was really really good. Never quite read anything like it.

It's about Alex trying to figure out where the rage that runs in himself and his
family comes from. It all boils down to his grandfather and he unearths a
dark and intriguing story. It's hard to describe to it's a deeply troubling story
but written in a warm way somehow - I can really recommend it.
