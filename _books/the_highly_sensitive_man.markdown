I read an interview with the author (Tom Falkenstein) in a Swedish newspaper
and got interested in this book. I have read a bit before about high sensitivity before 
in Elain Aaron's book but the subject in context of masculinity was intriguing.

I enjoyed the book a lot and I think many will find it very helpful and/or thought
provoking, even if you're not highly sensitive or a man. The book is a mix of 
theory, self-help with mindfulness and interviews.
