I've never liked running and I can probably count on one hand how many times I've done it. Still, I devoured this book from beginning to end. 

It feels, from time to time, hyperbole in its praise of how good running is, especially barefeet running, but otherwise this book is a real thrill. Adventures, historical anecdotes, exciting characters and one hell of a story. 

If there is one thing that could get anyone excited about running, it would be this book.
