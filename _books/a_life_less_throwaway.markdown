Much of this book wasn't new to me but still interesting. It's a sort of mix
between the thoughts seen in minimalism, environmentalism, Mari Kondo and
happiness research.

It contained a lot of interesting facts from research studies, which was one of the highlights
for me. On the down side, it's a little bit UK-centric and sell-y for the Author's
own website.

Overall, a decent read though. A bit depressiving at times unfortunately.
