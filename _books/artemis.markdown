I've been avoiding this book after reading a lot of really negative reviews, but, it was the only Andy Weir book I hadn't read yet. While it's not nearly in the same class as The Martian or Project Hail Mary, it's still an entertaining book and I enjoyed reading it.

I can understand why certain aspects of the book will be annoying for readers and it's not a top recommendation, but it wasn't nearly as bad as some people seem to think.
