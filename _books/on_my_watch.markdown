This book was written by Jens Stoltenberg who has been Norway's prime minister and the secretary general of NATO. It's a little bit of a general autobiography but the main focus is on his time at NATO. A lot of things happened during this time, many things that affected us here in Sweden: Trump becoming president and US pulling back support and threatening to leave, Russia invading Ukraine, Sweden and Finland joined NATO and Turkey blocking Sweden, US leaving Afghanistan. Very interesting book.
