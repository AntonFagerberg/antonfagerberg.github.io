This book is a sequel to Howl's moving castle, but they are very separate in story and it's not the same main characters.

They are similar in writing style and this book is just as lovely and nice. I really like it, it's a feel-good, fantasy-ish, book.

This book and Howl's moving castle are among the top books I've read this year, it's heartily recommended. (Read them in order, even though it doesn't matter that much.)
