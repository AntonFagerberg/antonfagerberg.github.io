The final book of the Bobiverse series, or at least the main trilogy as there seems to be one more (spin-off) book.

It continues just like the two other books - it's been a very consistent and even trilogy. 
It could've probably been just one big book if the author wanted.

The different story lines got their corresponding endings. Not any mind-blowing material but good closures.

Overall a solid trilogy. Would recommend! Not sure if I'm gonna read the spin-off next or do something different.
