It's been a long time since I read this book, more than a decade I think.
This time it's the first time I'm reading it in English.
While I do remember the story arc and the key plot points, I was surprised how
poetic, warm and much more beautiful it is than I remembered.

The characters feel very much alive, there is beauty and camaraderie. While the
book is almost 70 years old it feels like it could've been written today.
It's truly a timeless masterpiece!

I will continue reading the trilogy as I feel very
drawn into the world of Tolkien after finishing this one.
