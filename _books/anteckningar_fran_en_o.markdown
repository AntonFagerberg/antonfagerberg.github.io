This is a short book with notes / diary entries from, most notably, Tove Jansson 
about the house she and Tooti built on an island. 

It's quite difficult to review this book. 
For the Jansson fans and romantics, it's probably a fantastic book but for
everyone else it's probably fairly boring.

I have a leg in each camp so I'm not really sure what to make of it. It's not
a favorite for me.
