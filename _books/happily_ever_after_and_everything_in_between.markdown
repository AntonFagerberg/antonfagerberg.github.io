The third illustrated book I've read by Debbie Tung. Still liked the first of her books
the best (Quiet girl in a noisy world). All books are kinda similar - from the illustrations
to the auto-biographic nature of being a book loving introvert (now in a relationship).

It's cute, it's relatable (for me) and it's more of the same. A light easy read which
you can finish in one sitting. If you like her other books then you'll like this one.
