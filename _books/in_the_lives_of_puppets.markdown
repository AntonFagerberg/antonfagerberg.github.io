When I started reading this book I felt like this could be a new favorite. It started out so strong and wonderful! Unfortunately I think it started fumbling when ramping up the story and it never really recovered. With some rework this could've been truly great.

It's still a good and memorable book. It was exactly the kind of story I was looking for at the moment: a heart-warming, whimsical sci-fi. Not sure if I would recommend it though. Not a first pick at least.
