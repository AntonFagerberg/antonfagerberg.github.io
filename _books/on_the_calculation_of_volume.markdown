I really wanted to like this book but it just talks so much but says so little. The mood and setting is good, the plot laid out at first is intriguing but there's just too much feelings and random thoughts without any real progression. It's not a very long book but it was still a drag to finish it, unfortunately. I thought this was part one of two but I now see that it's six parts and there's no way I'm doing this again five more times. This one is a pass for me.
