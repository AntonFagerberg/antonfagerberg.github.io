Jan Emanuel has been a controversial person in Sweden. An ex-politician, entrepreneur, founder of treatment centers, reality-TV star and internet personality. This book is his autobiography, how he grew up as a criminal in sketchy environments and all the bad things he's done and how he thinks they should've been prevented. How he became a politician but was ousted. How he got super rich inventing a system for treatment centers. It's an entertaining book, often in a messed-up way. I feel empathy for him after reading the book.
