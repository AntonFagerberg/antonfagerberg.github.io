I've been reading this over a long time (and it is a fairly long book). Usually
I pick up Harry Potter when I want to read something cozy and escape reality - but
this far into the series it's a lot of misery as well.

This is the "Umbridge book" which everyone who has read it (or watched the movies) 
knows what it means. Nonetheless it is a Harry Potter and I enjoyed it. Looking
forward to when I can read the series with my kids. (And wow, it has been 5 years
  since I finished the third book - for the second time...)
