Continued immediately with the part 2 in the The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. The name of the book is (for those of you who've read it) brilliant. I especially like the part with the animal that wants to be eaten.

After having finished this one, I need a break to read something else before I continue to part 3. Although it is very good, it's a little too much to read book after book.
