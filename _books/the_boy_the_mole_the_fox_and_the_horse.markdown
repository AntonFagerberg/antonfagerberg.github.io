I found the author on Twitter (of all places...) back when I still used that.
It's one of those book that you can open on any page and there's an inspiring quote or dialog
with a beautiful, sketchy illustration.

When I'm feeling grumpy the book seems naive and simplistic, but when I'm
in a good mood I really enjoy it. It's a nice book to have at home in a spot where
it's easy to pick up, like a coffee table book. One day I'll read it with my children.
