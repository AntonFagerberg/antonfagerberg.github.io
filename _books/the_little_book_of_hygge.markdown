I can imagine that this book is mainly sold as a gift, or as a souvenir
coffee table book (from an air port gift shop, probably at Kastrup).

I've read a book by the author about making memories and it was interesting.
He works at the happiness institute and thus has a lot of interesting research
to share, in this book as well.

Unfortunately, at times it feels like a commercial for Denmark - and it can
be a bit too much in how wonderfully "hygge" things can be.
