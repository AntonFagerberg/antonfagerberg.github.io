My girlfriend picked this up from the library as she had read it once before when she was young. As it layed around at home I started reading it too. Switched over to the original English version after a while as I didn't want to miss out on the Yorkshire-accent writing. Eh!

It's an old book (from 1911) but it holds up very nicely. A book about healing and the power of being outside and tending to a flowers - relatable. Likable characters and not too dramatic. A sweet, positive book.
