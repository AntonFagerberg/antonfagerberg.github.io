I've had this book saved for a long time since it had such good reviews
but never got around to reading it (wasn't in the mood for war sci-fi). 
After having read it, I really wish I read it sooner because it's so good.
Definitely one of my top 3 this year.

Details such as that the protagonist is over 75 years old made the book something special.

I'm usually not a big fan of book series but I'll start reading the next one immediately.
