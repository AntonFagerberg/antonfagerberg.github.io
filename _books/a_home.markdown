A home, or "ett hem", as the original title is in Swedish has the same name as a book originally created by Carl Larsson himself.
This however is a new book about the lives of the Swedish artists and couple Carl & Karin Larsson.

The main focus of the book is about their home "lilla hyttn√§s" and their everyday life.
Despite this book describing their lives around 1900, it feels very modern in many ways.
It's a short and perhaps a bit shallow book, "coffee table"-style, but I really liked it a lot.
