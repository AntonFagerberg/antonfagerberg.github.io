I don't think I have binged a book like this before (finished it in two days). I'm usually not a big fan of dystopian books, they bum me out, but this series was really good. 
Dust continues where Wool and Shift left off and ties everything together nicely. A worthy final book in the series.

It's very much like Wool and Shift, the same pacing, lots of twists and turns & a lot of excitement. 
An interesting take on the fragility of society and humanity.
I'm emotionally exhausted after reading this. I need to decompress.
