Another book / novella by one of my favorite authors: Becky Chambers.
This one is a little bit more on the traditional "hard science fiction" side but still has that familiar hopeful and empathic tone and feeling.

For some reason I thought this was her oldest book but it's actually one of the newer ones, and sadly the last book of hers I hadn't already read.

I liked it very much! For sure one of my favorites books of hers and a book I would recommend as a good first "Becky Chambers book" for the uninitiated.
