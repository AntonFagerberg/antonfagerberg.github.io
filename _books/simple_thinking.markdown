As a person who (over)thinks a lot this book seemed very promising and the first part was really good. But, as with many "self help" books there's so much of "famous person does X and is successful, you should do it too".

While there are nuggets of wisdom in the book, it has way too much of "I worked with this celebrity" and "another book says this profound thing" so let me copy that.
