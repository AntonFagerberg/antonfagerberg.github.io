The true story about how a group of women in Stockholm started the first female only, member owned cooperative grocery store - selling exclusively produce of good quality (a big issue at the time).

The book gives an interesting insight in to how life was in the early 1900s in Stockholm, Sweden. It's not that long ago but a lot has changed since. For many reasons I'm glad I live in more modern times.
