I wanted to read a christmas-book to get into the holiday spirit and was torn between this one or "A christmas carol" by Charles Dickens. Picked this one in the end, mainly as I like the Harry Potter books and never read anything else by J.K. Rowlings.

I'm not the target audience for this book (as an adult), but I felt it was a bit unimaginative and obvious. Started out pretty decent but the "fantasy" aspect was not just for me. Not terrible but not great either.
