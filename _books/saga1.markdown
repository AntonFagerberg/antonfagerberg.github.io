I try from time to time to read graphic novels. It's something I "should" like but rarely get into. I start many of them but almost never finish any. Saga on the other hand got me good! I plowed through this 500 page book and loved every second of it.

The story is great, the art is great. It's fast paced, imaginative and very thrilling. Perfect to start reading now when there's a book version of the first 18 issues and even better, there's already a part 2 book!
