A (Swedish) book about flour, the problems with industrial farming, "modern" food and our health.
A love letter to farmers growing heirloom varieties of wheat, rye and other grains, working with nature in a small eco system.

It's a coffee-table-style-ish book but I learned a lot, at least on a high level, about many grains.
As someone who bakes sourdough break on a regular basis, this book made me seek out mills and buy new flours.
The book also has recipes but I've not yet tested any of them.
A topic I will explore more!
