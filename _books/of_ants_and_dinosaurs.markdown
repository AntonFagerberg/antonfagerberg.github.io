Ants and dinosaurs as the two intelligent species roaming the planet. Doesn't sound like a book I would pick up - but it is written by Cixin Liu and it is brilliant.

I really enjoyed it and even though his "three-body problem" was fantastic, it was nice to read a shorter book of him. It's definitely one of my recent favorites and highly recommended.
