I bought this graphical novel probably close to 20 years ago but never finished it.
My interest got rekindled now that I started watching the new HBO sequel series.

The main story arch and characters are good and interesting, but I must admin that I found
it a bit long winding and tedious at times. I didn't get that "masterpiece" feeling
so many other seems to have. Well worth a read nonetheless.
