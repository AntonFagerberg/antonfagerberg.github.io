This book (a.k.a. The Golden Compass - first in the trilogy of His Dark Materials) is probably the one that has been on my "to read"-list for the longest.
I've started reading it a few times but now I read enough to get hooked.

Good mystique fantasy story. A lot of likable characters. Just the right length and always exciting enough to be a page turner.

It's probably one of the best "young adult" books. I'll make my children read Harry Potter first, then I think this will be number two if they want more.
