I got this book as a Christmas present from my girlfriend some years ago but only
picked it up now after seeing Marie Kondo's Netflix series. I must say that I really
like the 'KonMari'-method. It seems simple but it's really smart, kinda like a mix of minimalism,
mindfulness and clever folding / storage techniques.

The writing is at times hyperbole but overall it's a small and solid book.
