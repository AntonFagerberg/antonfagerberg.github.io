This is likely the most fucked up story of a company I've ever read. It has everything. Batshit crazy leaders trying to create tech to save peoples lives which just doesn't work and instead hurts them, insane amount of venture capitalist money and total manipulation using prolific people and media hungry for success stories. It is one scary story which just grows and grows, well worth a read.
