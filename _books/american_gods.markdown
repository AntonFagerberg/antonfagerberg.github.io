I was going to say that this was my first Neil Gaiman until I noticed that he's the author of Coraline (which also has a fantastic movie adaptation). Anyway, it's been a while since a fictional book hooked me like this one did. It's one of those books that made me feel fully immersed in the described world.

Well written, good tempo, fantastic characters and environments - and as a bonus, you learn some things about more or less obscure gods.
