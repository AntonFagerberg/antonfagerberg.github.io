Another japanese book, probably the last for a while. It's about an "awkward" woman who has trouble being "normal" but finds herself functioning very well as a convenience store worker. My interpretation is that she is on the autism spectrum.

In a way it's a critique of our society, the structure and expectations. A few different angles are explored in the book along with a really annoying side-character. I thought it was OK, but not super good. I can't really put my finger on it but something about it didn't sit right with me.
