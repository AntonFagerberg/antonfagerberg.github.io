This book was not quite what I expected. It started off with an intriguing mystery, then described all "female struggles" (patriarchy, traditional roles, harassment, discrimination, periods etc...) of the main character's entire life for the remainder of the book and then the mystery was brushed away.

It's a good book, well written and interesting but perhaps best suited for those unfamiliar with the mentioned problems.
