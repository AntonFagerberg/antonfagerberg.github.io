I'm usually not a big fan of reading about entrepreneurs or business people, but
I do like a good biography and this had good reviews. Despite not knowing about
Phil Knight before and despite not caring much about shoes, this was a really
nice book.

Phil seems to be very human and an interesting, honest person. It was especially
fun to read about the early days and the connection to Japan.
