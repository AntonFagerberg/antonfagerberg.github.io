Part 1 of the "muderbot diaries" (it's better than it sounds). A pretty conventional sci-fi with witty writing. It's a short book, I guess all books in the series are. To be honest, it's not the best thing I've read. It's fine but it didn't captivate me. I may read the rest, at least one more to see if it gets more interesting (and because they are so short, it's not a big investment).

Still, I think others may enjoy it more than I did. If you're in to sci-fi, why not.
