If some books are a wholesome meal, rich in fibers and vitamins, then Ready Player Two is the greasiest junk food imaginable eaten straight out of a garbage can.

There is something good and enticing about it, but if you’re being honest, it wasn’t really that good. (But sometimes, on rare occasions, it’s what you want anyway.)

If you really loved Ready Player One, you can imagine what you’ll get (more of the same). 
If you didn't like it, you'll definitely hate this one.
