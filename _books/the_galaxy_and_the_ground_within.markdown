The final book in the Wayfarers-series. 
If you've read the other books you know what you'll get: a good, empathic story told from multiple characters point of view. 
The books are very loosely connected but are more or less stand-alone.

Different aliens temporarily stuck on a planet getting to know each other and working out their differences. It can be a bit "preachy" at times. And not very dramatic - that I didn't mind. 
It's very cozy, perhaps not a book for everyone.
