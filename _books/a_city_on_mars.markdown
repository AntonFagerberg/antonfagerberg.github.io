I picked this up mainly because of the many hilarious and smart comic strips created by Zach Weinersmith in SMBC.
This book, while pop-sci, turned out to be way more dense and technical than I expected.
It has a lot of humor but it is a serious and well researched book trying to make a real point.

Setting up a space station, and similar things, is a lot harder than most people (myself included) expects. 
This book makes great arguments about the problems, both technical as you might expect but also other aspects often overlooked since we're dealing with humans.
