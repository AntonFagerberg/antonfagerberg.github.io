The second and final part of the "robot and monk" series.
A lot of topics seem to be recurring themes in Becky Chambers' books (Wayfarers-series), like gender fluidity, polygamous relationships etc.
It's also tries to be very empathic. I heard that this book was described as "feel good" sci-fi which seems very fitting.

In the end though, it felt a bit unfulfilling for me. 
I liked the first book more, this second seemed to be just a direct continuation but not really any more interesting.
Still alright - good theme & thoughts.
