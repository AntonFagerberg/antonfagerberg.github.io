The autobiography of Jaques who grew up in Congo but had to flee after Mobutu started killing students. Jaques ended up, by accident, working in the Swedish Prison and Probation Service and quickly rose through the ranks. I thought the part of his upbringing and personal life was very interesting but a lof of the book is about the Swedish prison system, and while it's interesting it could almost be a separate book. A shame that it doesn't cover more of the recent developments in more depth. Decent book, generally good.
