I've heard a lot of recommendations about this book, on the radio etc, and
it seemed really nice in theory (by a Nobel price winner and all) with a theme
I appreciate (AI).

It's a bit strange, and in many ways it made me eerie when I read it. 
I'm not really sure what it is but the story seemed a bit shallow and the it never really gripped me. While I liked the characters, I didn't really care about them.
Not for me I guess.
