The premise of this books makes little sense when you explain it. Something like: trans-woman fleeing from abusive home, meeting a violin teacher, "the queen of hell", who made a pact with a demon to deliver souls to hell, who meets an alien family escaping from the end-plague and end up in a donut shop on earth.

Nevertheless, the book starts up a bit heavy but soon becomes a very entertaining and fun read. It's an easy read, exciting and dramatic but not too serious.
