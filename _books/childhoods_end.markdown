I've read a few of the classics by Arthur C Clarke but never heard of this one before. It was a very pleasant surprise! I really really liked this one, by far the best book of his I've read - and one of my top sci-fi's over all now.

It was published in 1953 but it feels very modern and many of the "predictions" are spot on (while still retro in the best of ways). Highly recommended for those who want to pick up a solid sci-fi book.
