This book would probably be described as "hard" sci-fi in that it feels very realistic and, perhaps, well researched. Epic in many ways, spanning long periods of time with multiple characters and timelines.

The overarching idea is interesting and it's well written but it also feels a little dry. Like I should love it but that there's something I can't put my finger on that's missing.

There are follow-up books - but this book stands on its own and I will not pick up the rest.
