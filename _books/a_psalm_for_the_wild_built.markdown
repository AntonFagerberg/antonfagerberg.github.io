This was a really nice book!
First of all, I really like that it's not very long - it really flew by to the point where I was genuinely surprised when it ended.
(As I understand it, it's a "duology" and I guess it could've been one large book.)

It's a post-apocalyptic story but where everything has turned for the better.
I guess solarpunk is a way to describe it.
There's a lot about this world, culture and religion that I really like. 

And as always with Becky Chambers, it feels very warm and empathic.
I will jump on the sequel right away!
