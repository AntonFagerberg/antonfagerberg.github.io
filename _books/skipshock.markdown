This book feels like it will become a tv-series in a few years, and it reads a bit like one too in some ways. 
I've got mixed feelings about it. The main premise was really good and interesting but I feel like towards the ending it felt unsure of where to go and how to wrap things up. I though this would be a stand-alone book but towards the end it felt clear that things won't be concluded and I'm sure there will be follow-up books. There's a lot to be liked though and at times it's great.
