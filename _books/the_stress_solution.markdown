I rarely finish any of the "self help" books that I start but this one I plowed
right through. While the theme of the book is stress, it's a really good read
for general advice about how to live a good and healthy life.

Some of the things I've heard before, but there was also quite a lot of solid
advice in a range of different areas - sleep, food, clutter, touch, sound, smart
phones, breathing, yoga and much more. (A notepad might be required to remember
all good ideas.)

As a collection of good advice bundled in to one easy to read book, this is a
book I can recommend wholeheartedly.
