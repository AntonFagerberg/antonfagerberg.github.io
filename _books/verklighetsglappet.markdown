A Swedish book with a title roughly translated to "the reality gap". I would summarize it as a book for people who either set too high (unrealistic) goals or have too low ambitions (afraid or just stuck). It's about people who are not really aligned with reality and what's possible.

I think it's a really good book, it's perhaps primarily useful for people in their 20s / 30s, when transitioning in to adulthood one way or another.
