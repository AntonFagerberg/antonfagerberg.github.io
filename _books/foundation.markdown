I've been meaning to read this book for perhaps 15 years and I finally got around to do it.
Despite its age, the book holds up very well and still feels modern.

I though it was a solid book, at times a bit slow but overall very good.
Maybe because I've heard that it's a masterpiece I had a bit too high expectations. 
I'll definitely read the two other books in the main trilogy (but probably not the other ones).
