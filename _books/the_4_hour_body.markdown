Tim Ferris is an partly interesting, partly insane, and always rigorously testing and trying out new things. This book is intended to give you tips for getting a hot body. While many things sounds scientifically rooted, some just isn't and that undermines the entire book. Two glasses of red wine every day is ok - could that be because Tim really likes wine? Sleep 2 hours per day and perform better than on 8 hours - are you fucking kidding me?

There's also a chapter about sex which include detailed guides along the lines of "do 9 half-insertions followed by one full insertion, repeat for five minutes" and an anecdote along the lines "once I ate huge amounts of stake and I made ladies so horny that they threw themselves at me". Ugh...
