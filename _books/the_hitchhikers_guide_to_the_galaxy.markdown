Truly one of the classics in "geek literature". I read this when I was around 13 (I think) in Swedish so it was time to re-read it and in English this time. I've picked it up once before but thought it had too much nonsense then. This time I was ready for nonsense and it was great!

It's smart, it's funny and there's a lot going on all. Will definitely read the rest of the series now.
