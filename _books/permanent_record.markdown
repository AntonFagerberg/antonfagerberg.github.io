The autobiography of Edward Snowden. I'd seen the documentary Citizenfour and
the movie Snowden before, but this book is more personal and deeper.
My impression of Snowden has always been that he's very articulate and intelligent - 
it's true about this book as well.

NSA scandal aside, we both grew up in the same age with the arrival of the internet
and reading his early life stories reminded me about my youth.
