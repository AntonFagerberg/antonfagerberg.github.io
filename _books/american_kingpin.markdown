This is the story about the notorious dark web site Silk Road and the man behind it. This is one hell of a story. It's informative but at the same extremely entertaining, like a real good thriller, almost to good to be real.

This book his highly recommended, not just for the technically inclined but for everyone who wants to read a really gripping and fascinating story.
