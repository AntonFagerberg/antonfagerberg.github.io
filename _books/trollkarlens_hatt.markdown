The second book (Finn Family Moomintroll in English) about the Moomins from Tove Janssons that I read. This is the book where Thingumy and Bob arrive clutching a large suitcase containing the King's Ruby which they stole from the Groke. I once saw a documentary about Tove Jansson where it was claimed that this was based on Tove's love towards another woman which they had to keep secret since homosexuality was illegal at the time in Finland.
