	<h1>About myself &amp; this site</h1>
	<p>
As you might have guessed from the domain name; my name is Anton Fagerberg. I am a software developer who lives in Lund, Sweden, where I study Computer Science and Engineering (M.Sc. in Engineering) at Lund University. My specialisation is Software in systems - "to develop large program systems, advanced programming techniques and software engineering solutions".
</p>

<p>
I am a part-time employee of <a href="http://www.jayway.com">JayWay</a> where I mainly do backend work with Java. I was previously an employee of <a href="http://www.bring.se">Bring</a> where I designed and developed business-critical systems in Scala for managing everything from linehauls and shipments to orders and parcels.
</p>

<p>
Currently, my heart beats for Scala which I really enjoy. In my opinion, it's a good blend of object-oriented and functional programming albeit a bit complicated and heavy. I have done a lot of web development with the Play Framework (Scala) professionally which has been a very pleasant experience. I have in the past worked with some Haskell, PHP and Ruby. I did an iOS app in Objective-C which I had in the app store for a year and I know my way around C++. 
</p>

<p>
A nice side effect or studying at the university is that you get an opportunity to try a lot of (not always so nice) things like Prolog, Assembly and Perl. That said, I really like to explore programming languages and the quest for the perfect language is an ongoing adventure.
</p>

<p>
I like open source and try to have openness as my general approach in life. I've created this site as a place for me to write what's on my mind, to show off some projects and talk a bit about myself. Check out the links above and for additional information or check out my <a href="https://github.com/AntonFagerberg">GitHub</a> page to see what I'm currently working on.
