  title: "Dlerss - RSS Downloader"
  categories: projects
---

This project is inspired by RSSDler ([code.google.com/p/rssdler](https://code.google.com/p/rssdler/)), but this project does not have as many features.
The only thing this application does is that it downloads files linked in RSS (XML) feeds if the titles are matched against some regular expression.
I've also [written a version in Elixir](https://github.com/AntonFagerberg/gimme).

### Example configuration
```bash
# Names of all enabled feeds.
names = [ "coolfeeds", "hotfeeds" ]

# Display thrown exceptions (such as failing urls).
showExceptions = true

# URL to feed (XML).
coolfeeds.url = "https://..."
# Scan intervals in minutes.
coolfeeds.scanTime = 10
# Download all files which has a match in:
coolfeeds.regexTrue = "(Kittens|Dogs)"
# But ingore all files which has a match in (set to ^$ to disable):
coolfeeds.regexFalse = "$^"
# Save files to this folder:
coolfeeds.saveFolder = "/my/cool/folder"

hotfeeds.url = "https://..."
hotfeeds.scanTime = 5
hotfeeds.regexTrue = "(KittyNews S\\d{2}E\\d{2}|DogTimes Season [1-5])"
hotfeeds.regexFalse = "Fluffy"
hotfeeds.saveFolder = "/my/hot/stuff"
```

### Build
To build a "fat" self-contained executable, use the SBT assembly provided in this project.

```text
sbt assembly
```

This will generate a self-contained JAR-file, see command output for the location where it is saved.

### Run
If assembly has been used to create the JAR-file, you can execute the file with either Java or Scala:

```text
scala dlerss.jar
```

```text
java -jar dlerss.jar
```

By default, dlerss will look for a configuration file in the current directory called "application.conf". To specify another configuration file, simply specify it as the first argument:

```text
scala Dlerss.jar ../folder/bad-ass.conf
```

### Dependencies

```scala
"com.typesafe" % "config" % "1.0.2"
```

### Regular Expressions
This is a good site to learn more:

[tutorialspoint.com/scala/scala_regular_expressions.htm](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/scala_regular_expressions.htm)

Note that to match for example digits, you have to use \\\\d with double back slashes to not mess up the string in the configuration file.
