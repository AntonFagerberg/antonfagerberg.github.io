I did a introduction to Spark lab for the employees of [Jayway](https://www.jayway.com). It contains method stubs which should be implemented as a way to learn the different parts of Spark. The goal was to minimize setup hassle and thus there's (almost) no installation / configuration needed and everything run locally.

The workshop was divided into five parts:

1. Basic RDD functions.
2. Pair RDD functions.
3. Shared variables - accumulator and broadcast variables.
4. Partitioner.
5. Iterative / recursive function.
