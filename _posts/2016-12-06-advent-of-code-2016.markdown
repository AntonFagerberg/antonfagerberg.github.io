To my big joy there was another round of wonderful programming puzzles from [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) in 2016.

This year I've been solving them in Haskell to learn more about the language. You can find my collection of solutions [on GitHub](https://github.com/AntonFagerberg/advent_of_code_2016).
