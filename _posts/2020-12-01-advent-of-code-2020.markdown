Another year of [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com), I was going to stay away from it but I couldn't help myself to at least do a little.

With two small kids and a house in need of renovations, I don't think I will solve many days, but I'll try to do a few.

I've been wanting to try a Lisp for a few years and thought about either [Racket](https://racket-lang.org) or [Clojure](https://clojure.org). In the end I went with Clojure (so JVM language 4 years in a row). Perhaps next year I'll pick Racket (or at least something non-JVM).
