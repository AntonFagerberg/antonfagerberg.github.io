KinectWare was a WarioWare inspired project I created as part of the Virtual Reality course at Lund University. I developed remakes of the classical games Pong, Arkanoid and Marble Blast which you control with your body in different ways using a Microsoft Kinect.

The (first) Kinect is actually pretty bad but the games worked very well. The games where developed using the [Unity 3D engine](http://unity3d.com/) and [ZigFu](http://zigfu.com/) which made the development fairly easy!
