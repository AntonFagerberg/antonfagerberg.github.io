Comic baker is an experimental online comic book / graphical novel organizer and reader for desktop, tablet and mobile. Think of it as your own cloud service for storing, organizing and reading graphical novels anywhere. I use this to play around with early versions of the [Phoenix Framework](http://phoenixframework.org/).
