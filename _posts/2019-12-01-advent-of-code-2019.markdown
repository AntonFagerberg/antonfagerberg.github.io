One more year with [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com), I've been doing it
for so many years now that it makes me nostalgic and filled with Christmas spirit!

I haven't finished the recent years due to lack of personal time and I probably 
won't finish this year either - but it's a good opportunity to try out a new language.

This year I decided to give [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) a try. At first I 
was thinking about using [Go](https://golang.org), but
there is just not enough time (Kotlin will be much easier since I already
know Java and Scala).
