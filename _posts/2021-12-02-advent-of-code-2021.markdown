Another year of [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com), no tradition like it! ðŸŽ„

I've probably got even less time than last year (it's a bad trend right now...), but I'll do a few just to keep the tradition alive.
This year I'll use [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Don't have a good motivation why.
