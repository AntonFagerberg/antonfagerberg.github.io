I was discussing Super Mario 3D vs 2D games with a friend who made the joke that I should make Snake in 3D (since I made [Snakespand](/projects/snakexpand/) and [RainbowSnake](/projects/rainbowsnake/) recently).

So of course I had to do that. It's a super simple proof of concept lacking many of the proper game mechanics. I think it could be a fun project with proper camera support and other things, but I don't think I'll continue working on it. But you know what? It's super fun to make these micro-projects in an hour or two. This was my first attempt at doing 3D in LibGDX.

(I haven't built it for the web either like my other games so you have to compile it from source to try it... sorry!)
