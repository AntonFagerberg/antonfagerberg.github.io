The skip list is a interesting probabilistic data structure which can be used as an alternative to trees. Below is a simple implementation in Java using generics to store key-value pairs and therefore works as a map.

Code available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/AntonFagerberg/SkipList-Map-Java).
