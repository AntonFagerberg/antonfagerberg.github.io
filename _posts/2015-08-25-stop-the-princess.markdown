Stop the Princess! is a turn based strategy game in which you hire monsters in order to stop the princess from saving the prince. It was made for [Ludum Dare 33](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=56405) which had the theme "you are the monster". I did the programming (using JavaScript and [Phaser](http://www.phaser.io)) and my friend Alex did the graphics.
