We had a friendly competition at [Jayway](http://www.jayway.com) where I work which was: who could get the best result in different instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem. I wrote my solver in C++ to refresh my knowledge there an it worked fairly well - although my theory in the subject wasn't the best. I quickly achieved very good results on the smaller instances but had problems dealing with instances of 10,000 nodes or greater.

The code can be modified in different ways depending on the instance and need.
