Checkpoint was written for Pan Nordic Logistics to help them achieve a new security classification which included that no drivers where allowed inside the terminal area. Checkpoint scheduled the incoming linehauls and communicated with third party systems to unlock doors, manage traffic lights and send real-time information to the drivers PDAs. Checkpoint also featured a touch-screen interface used on truck-mounted PC's inside the terminal area.

It was featured in the Swedish magazine [Intelligent Logistik, page 37](/files/intelligent_logistik.pdf).
