During a week I experimented with Java and LibGDX by making three Snake-game experiments.
They are all "one evening" projects. Very unpolished and a bit weird.

 - [Snakexpand](/projects/snakexpand) - you fill up the screen and it expands
 - [RainbowSnake](/projects/rainbowsnake) - you grow a lot and eat yourself
 - [Snake3D](/projects/snake3d) - snake in three dimensions
