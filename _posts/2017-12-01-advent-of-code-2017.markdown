Yet another year with [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com)! I just got a new born baby so time will be sparse this year so we'll see how much I'll lag behind.

I decided to use [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) since time is sparse instead of trying out a new language (was initially thinking about trying out [Racket](http://racket-lang.org)).
