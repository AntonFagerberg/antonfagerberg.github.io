This is a free e-book written by Mikito Takada which covers a variety of topics associated with distributed programming. It's kinda short and I imagine some might say that it only scrapes the surface while other will get more than enough details. In my opinion, it's enough to make you understand the fundamental aspects while deliberately avoiding the complicated, gritty details. If you do want to understand something in detail, the author will point you to the appropriate place for that as well.
