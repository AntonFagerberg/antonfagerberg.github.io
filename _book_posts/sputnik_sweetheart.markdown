I've read a lot of Murakami and I used to love them, but at some point they are just too similar to fully enjoy. There's this joke image of a "Murakami bingo" with cats, a well, classical music / jazz, parallel worlds, and so on and this book checks most of them.

It's a good book though, on the shorter side and thus isn't as rich as 1Q84 or the wind-up bird chronicle.
