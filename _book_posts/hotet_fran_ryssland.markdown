The threat from Russia (in Swedish). I thought I would educate myself a little bit in the wake of the war in Ukraine.
There's understandably quite a lot of overlap with a couple of documentaries that I've seen recently so they're a bit intertwined in my memory - but the book seems like a good overview of what Russia / Putin is and has been doing. What's especially good about this book (for me) is that it puts everything in a Swedish perspective. If that's what you're looking for, this is a good read. Good length and depth.
