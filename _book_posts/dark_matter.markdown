I heard a lot of hype about this book but to me it didn't really deliver. It had some really good plot points and a few very interesting ideas but for the most part it felt like a shallow Hollywood movie in book form. 

I gave up reading this book twice but somehow still plowed on. Was it worth finishing? Yes. Would I recommend it? No. (Unless you're in the mood for a Hollywood-like story, then go for it!)
