I've been looking at documentary series about the 'gang wars' in Järva (Stockholm).
The author of this book is a journalist who's featured a lot in it, and this book
covers much of the same thing - but in more depth.

It's a really well written and interesting book, but also dark and horrible. There's
a lot of murders, drug dealing, crimes, gangster rap, fast cars, expensive watches
and macho culture. Poor young men / boys who are outside of society with no place to go.
