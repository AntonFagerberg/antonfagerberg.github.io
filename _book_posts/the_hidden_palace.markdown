This is a sequel to The Golem & The Jinni (which I loved). It's very similar to the first book, and since it didn't really need a sequel it felt a bit pointless at first. But as the stories progressed, it grew on me and by the end I really enjoyed it.

For me, The Golem & The Jinni is better. It's still good though if you want more of the same thing or if you're interested in the loose knots from the first book.
