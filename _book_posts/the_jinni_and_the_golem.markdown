I'm not sure what category to place this book in, perhaps "modern fairy tale" is appropriate.
Whichever it is, this book was excellent. Well written, many deep and interesting characters
and a good overall arch tying together the different storylines.

This is a book I'll remember and carry with me for a long time. For grown-ups hesitant
towards "fantasy", this is a good tip. I'm looking forward to the next book from the author.
