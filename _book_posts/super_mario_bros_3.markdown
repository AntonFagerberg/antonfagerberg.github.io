Alyse Knorr, the author of this book, tell the story about the development and legacy of the Nintendo game Super Mario Bros. 3 but also the story of her experience of growing up as a girl who preferred video games over barbies. The two stories are intertwined throughout the book, you read about the launch of the game, the design of the mechanics and other curiosities for a while to then switch over to the other more personal story about her life and how Super Mario affected it. I enjoyed reading it a lot!
