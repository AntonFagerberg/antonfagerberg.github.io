I've heard a lot about this book on the podcast [greater than code](https://www.greaterthancode.com). The book is written by Marshall Rosenberg and details his communication process. It's one of those books you should revisit and read several times. Generally a very good book, gave me a lot to think about and I think it does improve communication skills. At times the real world stories seems almost too good to be true. Still too early to tell if the approach works or not, but I believe it will (at least to some degree).
