Have you seen that clip with a fungus infecting an ant, turning it into a "zombie", 
making it climb as high up as it can and then the fungus sprouts out of it's head? 
Imagine if an author similar to Andy Weir wrote a book about that happening to 
humans and that's kinda what this book is. That's not a bad thing at all!

It's not filled with unnecessary stuff, it's just good characters, interesting
plot(s) and on we go with things happening! I like it!
