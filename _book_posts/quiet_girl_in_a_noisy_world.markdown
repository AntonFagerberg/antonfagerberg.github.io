Subtitled "An Introvert's Story", this is a graphical novel from Debbie Tung who is, like me, an INFJ according to the Myers-Briggs test. The book is, I presume, most enjoyable if you're an introvert yourself and thus can relate to all the feelings and situations. I guess it can also serve as a good introduction for extroverts to learn more about introversion without having to plow through a dense book like Quiet (also mentioned here on this page).

The book itself looks kinda thick but not much text so you can plow through it in one sitting if you wish.
