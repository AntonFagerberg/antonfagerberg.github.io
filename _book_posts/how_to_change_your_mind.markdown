I've kept my eyes on Michael Pollan after seeing his excellent Netflix series Cooked. Never thought I would read a book about psychedelic drugs though, but this was a fascinating and many times mind blowing (no pun intended) read.

The book explains how psychedelics can be used as medicinal treatments and why it's starting to be accepted now despite having been around for decades. It's also a good historical book which dives into many different angles and persons.

Two quotes stuck with me: "the betterment of well people", as in we can be better even though we're not sick and "Psychedelics, used responsibly and with proper caution, would be for psychiatry what the microscope is for biology and medicine or the telescope is for astronomy." (Stanislav Grof).
