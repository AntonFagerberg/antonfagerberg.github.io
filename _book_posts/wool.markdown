I picked up this book a while back when I urged a new sci-fi story. To my annoyance, this
is yet another trilogy (-ish depending how you see it).

Nevertheless, humanity living in a silo underground turned out to be an intriguing concept
in other ways than I expected. I won't jump directly into the next book in the
series, but it was a good book on its own.
