It's hard not to notice the super entrepreneur Elon Musk, mostly known as the man behind Tesla and SpaceX. This book gives a colorful insight into his life and the history of himself as well as his companies.

After reading it I found myself partly amazed at his tireless efforts to continue no matter what backlashes, but also disgusted about how he treats his employees including being mad at a co-worker for leaving to witness the birth of his child.
