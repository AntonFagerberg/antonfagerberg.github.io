I've started reading many psychology / life philosophy books but rarely finish any of them. This one on the other hand, despite the easy to misunderstand title, hooked me good and I binged it in two days.

I found it had some really solid life advice that resonated with me packed, in an easy to read and straight forward way. To give some critique, I think the book lost speed and focus towards the last two hours or so.
