I read all the Harry Potter books in Swedish while growing up, now many years later I thought it was time to revisit them and experience them in their original language.

The first book in the series was as good as I remembered it and I think it still holds up. It's an amazing magical world to escape from reality into!

(I feel like Harry & Gryffindor wins a bit too much, poor Slytherins.)
