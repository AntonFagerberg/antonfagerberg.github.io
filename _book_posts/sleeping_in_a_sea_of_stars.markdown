This book is an epic sci-fi, epic being good and bad. It's long and it kinda reads like a manuscript for a video game, or a Netflix series, for some reason.

It's one of those books that should be amazing in theory and there are many excellent bits, but... there is something shallow about it that I can't quite put my finger on. Good and worth reading anyway.
