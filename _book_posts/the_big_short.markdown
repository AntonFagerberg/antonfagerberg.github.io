I tend to avoid financial things as much as possible since they bum me out but I have seen the movie adaptation of this book many times and really liked it.

The book is similar but more in depth. Many financial concepts flew over my head (which is kinda the premise of the book) but it was still a very good read. A story everyone should know and be really upset about.
