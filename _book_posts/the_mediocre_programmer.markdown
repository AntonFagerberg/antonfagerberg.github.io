Having read the classics the passionate programmer and the pragmatic programmer,
I had to pick-up the mediocre programmer. The title was irresistible and it's 
even [free as an e-book](http://themediocreprogrammer.com).

The book, I think, is especially a great help for junior developers or developers who feel
stuck in their career, although everyone will learn something. It's not very long (good length), it's on point and it 
has many solid advices; from using version control to learning new things and
avoiding burn-out.
