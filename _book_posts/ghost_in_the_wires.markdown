I remember renting the movie 'takedown' about Kevin Mitnick with my dad on VHS when I was a teenager and I found it fascinating. This book is Kevin's own version of what happened as well as other stories from his life.

The book is highly entertaining and it's a bit mind blowing what he pulled off. On the other hand, it's a bit sad. He seems to have some form of compulsive addiction to hacking despite it keeps making his life worse and worse.
