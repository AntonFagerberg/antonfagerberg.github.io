This is the third book (of four) in the Wayfarers-series.
In many ways it's similar to the previous ones.
It's the same "universe", species, the same warm writing and (new) likable characters.

Like the other two books, it follows a coulpe of different characters, each with their own stories that occasionaly intertwine.
I would describe the tempo of the book to be slow.
Almost a bit non-dramatic. It kinda feels like real history, non-grandious in an everyday sense.
It's good stuff.
