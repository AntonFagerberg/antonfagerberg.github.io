The third book in the series and it was more of the same. I was really in the
mood for it when I started reading but as time progressed I found myself
bored and even a bit annoyed at the same slew of conflict, sex and... just more 
of the same.

There were one or two interesting story arcs but overall I lost interest. 
As I finished it, I felt no longing for the next book as I did before.
