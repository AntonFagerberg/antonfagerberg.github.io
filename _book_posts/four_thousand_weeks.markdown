I read this book primarily for help with managing a never-ending workload. 
This book has some insights about that but it is also a self-help / life advice book about the finitude of life.

As always, there's a couple of good ideas (which should've probably been a few blog post / articles).
The books is filled with a lot of "as person X says: bla bla" related to what the author thinks.

The books is decent but frankly I've had enough of self-help / life-hack books and this will be the last one that I read for a very long time (if not ever).
