Picked this up since I really liked the "Old man's war"-series by Scalzi. 
This book is very different, for some reason I imagine this being a fun side-project for the author (not sure why).

I really liked it though! Good, likable characters. 
Relatable take on contemporary events in contrast with a completely different world of Kaiju earth (especially liked the idea of how Kaiju works and operates).

And as always, liked that it was a stand-alone book with an ending.
