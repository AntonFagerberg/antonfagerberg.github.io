An autobiography by Elaf Ali, born in Iraq but raised in Sweden. 
It's primarly about living with a culture of honor and shame / family honor and
trying to break free from it.

While it is in many ways a horrible story, it's also in many ways uplifting and 
inspiring. I especially like the angle of having interviews with her father.

It's a good read about an imporant topic. In Swedish only as far as I know.
