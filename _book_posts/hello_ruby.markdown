A childrens book about programming? Sounds weird but it absolutely works!
I bought it when it was first released and I also had the pleasure to invite
the author Linda to here when I was in the Ã˜redev conference program committee.

This time I re-read it for the first time for my daughter. She's too small to 
understand anything yet but she seemed to enjoy my voice and looking at the pictures.

I'll be sure to read it to her more times as she grows up.
