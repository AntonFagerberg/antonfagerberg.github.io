It has been a long time since I read the original Harry Potter books but back then I really loved them. This book took a little while to get used to reading since it is a script for a play. This gives the story a weird flow but after a while it's pretty nice, fast paced and mainly dialog.

I'm not really fond of 'grown up' Harry Potter who avoids eating sugar - I want an escape from reality. Overall though it's good enough.
