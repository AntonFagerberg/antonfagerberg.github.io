I really thought I was going to like this one but I didn't. It isn't a bad book, it's just that after
reading a few pages I knew exactly where this was going. There was almost no surprises or twists, and that
made it a tedious read for me. Perhaps I got sour by all reviewers who seemed to love it.

There may be lessons to be learned (if you've lived under a rock for the last 100 years).
