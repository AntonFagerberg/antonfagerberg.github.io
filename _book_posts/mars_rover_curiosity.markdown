An inside story of the history of the Mars rover Curiosity and the lander it used. It's told through the eyes of Rob Manning, the Chief Engineer at NASA / JPL,  and details from the conception of the idea to landing on Mars.

The focus is mainly through engineering, what problems arose, how they were solved and the politics surrounding the process. It's for the more nerdy of us but an interesting read nonetheless.
