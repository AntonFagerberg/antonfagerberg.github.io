Black Klansman, the true story of how a black cop infiltrated the KKK (I haven't seen the movie adaptation). It's a good, interesting story but to me it wasn't really a super exciting page-turner.

It has many good 'scenes' and anecdotes but it wasn't as dramatic as I'd expected and it didn't wrap up in a satisfying way (hard to criticise since it's a real story).
