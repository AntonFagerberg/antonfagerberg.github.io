This is a truly epic graphical novel collection with almost 40 issues (a coworker bought the huge bundle). I've seen he movie several times before, although many years ago now, and while it's good, it is a bit confusing and not fully coherent (as I remember it). The graphical novels are more thorough and make lot more sense, and while the story is similar, it's also very different so you should definitely read this and not just see the movie (or see the movie afterwards if you havenâ€™t looked at either).

At times, it is a little too violent for extended periods of time for my taste and in honesty it could probably have been a bit shorter. Overall though, it was a good read which captivated me during my holiday. Many dystopian and post-apocalypse vibes to be had.
