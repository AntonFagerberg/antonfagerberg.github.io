A Swedish book about the Swedish gangster-rap scene, especially in context with the recent gang wars and violence.
There's a bit of overlap with the book "Tills alla dör", but this one is not as deep and, as expected, is more focused on the music.

It gives an interesting insight in to how it works, why censorship is problematic and why the gangster lifestyle is idolized.

Overall, a decent book. I would recommend "Tills alla dör" if I had to pick just one.
