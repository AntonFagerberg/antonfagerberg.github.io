This is a Swedish book about doing business on the stock market. It's a light read with 150 pages and it teaches you the most fundamental things to think about when dealing with stocks. The text is not very technical so it is easy to understand but it lacks depth (but that's what I wanted). To me it felt very down to earth with a focus on long term goals and a reasonable growth rate.
