The second part in the three-body problem trilogy and it is fantastic. This series is by far the best science-fiction that I've read to date. It follows up the first book, at first slow but then accelerates madly just getting better and better. Mind blown over and over by the brilliant author.

At the time of writing this I'm already several hours into the final book and I can't put it down!
