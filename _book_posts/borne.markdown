I haven't read anything by this author before but I've seen the movie adaptation
of Annihilation which was ok. This book sucked me in from the start, I really
liked the setup and the world building - but about half way through it lost me.

I'm not sure if it's just me but I stopped caring about the characters and where 
the story was going. It's not a bad book, I just stopped being engaged by it.

With that in mind, it's not a book I would recommend.
