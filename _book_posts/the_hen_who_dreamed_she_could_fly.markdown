A cute, but at the same time, dark and challenging story about a hen who longs for freedom and a better life. Many parallels can be drawn to how we humans live and I think we all can relate at least to some of the events which takes place throughout the book. The book is not very long which I liked; it's condensed, well written and I think it will stay with me for a long time.
