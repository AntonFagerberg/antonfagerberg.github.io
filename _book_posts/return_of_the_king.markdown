As the trilogy comes to an end, it feels like I've been on a long journey as well.
Part of it is the way that it's written, at times slow pacing with much details.
Some people seem to dislike it but when you're in the mood it's really nice.

A fitting (and long) ending for one of the best fantasy books ever. 
It's a book series everyone should read - even if you've seen the movies, the books have a lot more to give.

That said, it's quite a lot to read them all back to back. After this, I need something entirely different.
But, I loved all three books very much.
