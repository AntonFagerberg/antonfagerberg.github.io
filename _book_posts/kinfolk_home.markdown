This seems to be the holy grail of coffe table-books, as seen in every trendy home. 
I started reading it during my vacation and thought it would be super pretentious, and while it kinda is, it's also a lot of sound and good ideas.

It's a mix of views into peoples home (a lot of Scandinavia / Japan / California) and essays about living a meaningful life and having a good home.

Slow living, a bit of minimalism, generally humane and down to earth. It's not a life-changing experience but it's a cozy book, perfect to read a chapter once in a while.
