Movin on to the second book in the trilogy of His Dark Materials.
The book continues almost directly where the first book ended and overall it's more of the same - good stuff.

It felt like this book toyed with my emotions a lot more (not sure if it's just me). At times I felt very
stressed when reading the "exciting" parts. It builds you up and breaks you down.

This book seems to set the stage for an epic finale and I wonder if the last book can deliver that ending. We'll see.
