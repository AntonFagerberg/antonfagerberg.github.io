Seeing the title, I knew this was a book I had to read. The book covers several famous authors, from Kafka and Hemingway to J.K. Rowling and Dan Brown. Each part begins with a short introduction of the author in question, who they were and what makes their writing style special. After that, a solution to a problem (in JavaScript) is shown, as if it was written by the author in question, in his/her own particular writing style. Finally, we get an analysis of the solution, what JavaScript quirks the author used and how it's tied to their previous literary works. The balance act between brilliance and nonsense is difficult but in the end, I enjoyed it very much!
