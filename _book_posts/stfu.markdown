This is a perfect example of how bad contemporary books are written.
The book seems super interesting at first, but the original content would fit a blog post.
So the book is filled with every current popular concept, bent to fit the authors "new concept" of STFU.

I'm so tired of hearing about Silicon Valley CEOs, meditation, Steve Jobs, Ikigai, forest bathing, happy nordic countries, social media anxiety, start-ups, problems with parenting, etc... Don't read.
