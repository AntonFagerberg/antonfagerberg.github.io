Another book, or comic strip collection, by Debbie Tung who also wrote
"Quite girl in a noisy world" which I loved. This book on the other hand is
a mixed bag. It's somewhat similar but lacks depth, or I just didn't
relate enough to the book-fan-vibe.

There are a few gems in it but there are also quite a lot of strips that just 
feels shallow. Pick up her other book is my suggestion.
