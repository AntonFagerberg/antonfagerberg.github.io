I finished this book in a day. Like the previous book I read by the same author,
this is a dark but very interesting story. This time about his parents, mainly 
his mother who is struggling with alcoholism (among other things).

It's in many ways very similar to "bränn alla mina brev", the writing and mood
is something you recognize in both. It's in a bizarre way a prequel / sequel thing.

I liked "bränn alla mina brev" better but this book is also really good. It's 
amazing that Alex (the author) is a functioning human being at all.
