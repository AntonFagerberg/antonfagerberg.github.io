This was such a fascinating read. Depressing for sure, but also enlightening and
a bit hopeful. The only downside is that it's a bit US-centered (and it could be a bit shorter and more concise).

I would recommend everyone to read this book, and if you don't feel like reading the entire thing then
grab a summary somewhere because it's super interesting stuff know.

You won't look at food and flavor the same way again. Hopefully it will make your life
better in the process as well.
