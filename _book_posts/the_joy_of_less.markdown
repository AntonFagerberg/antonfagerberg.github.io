The minimalism movement makes a lot of sense to me and I really like it (when it's not to cult-y). This books is a mixed bag of what I've head from The Minimalists, cleaning guru Marie Kondo and many environmentalists.

It's mostly good, practical but feels a bit targeted to women in the USA. For me, it was one of those books which started out good but I lost interest half-way in.
