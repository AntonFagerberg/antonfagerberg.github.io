Continuing with the next book in the amazing Saga series. Book two brings more of the good from book one and continues in the same vein. If you liked book 1 then you'll definitely also like book 2. The only sad thing is that there is no book 3 yet so either I have to start reading the smaller releases (single issues or smaller volume collections) or wait for the next book. Not sure what I'll do, but I'm 100% sure that I will continue to read this fantastic series in some way.
