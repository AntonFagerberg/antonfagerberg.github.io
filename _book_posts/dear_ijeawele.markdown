How to raise a child as a feminist, written as a letter from the author (Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, mentioned below) to her friend. It's short, concise, easy to read / understand and on point. It served as a good reminder for me that not all countries or communities has progressed particularly much, at least I would be truly chocked if I heard anyone telling the parents of a new born girl that you wish she find a good husband when she grows up.
