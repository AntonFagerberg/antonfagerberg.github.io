This is an extremely good & touching book written by Yeon-mi Park. She was born in North Korea, fled to China but was forced into trafficking until finally reaching South Korea. It's unbelievable how much misery Yeon-mi has been through. The book will both give you a chance to peek in to the mind of someone raised in a dictatorship and how adapting to the outside modern world can be challenging, but also a how traffickers take advantage of the ones in need.
