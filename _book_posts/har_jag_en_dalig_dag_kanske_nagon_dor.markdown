Another hospital-related book; this time an autobiography of the doctor Christian Unge. A big part of the book describes the time he spent with doctors without borders which was a real eye-opener and probably the best parts of the book.

The other parts, focusing on his career trajectory and how the Swedish health care system works, was an interesting read as well.
