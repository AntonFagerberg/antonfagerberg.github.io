I saw an interesting tv show about how our brain works by the author, though
I must admit that I don't remember much more beside it being interesting.

This book is about some of the big problems with our brain, mainly depression and
anxiety. It seems to be very well anchored in science, it's
easy to read and can be (I presume) very helpful.

Throughout the book, I had quite a few "mind blown"-moments and I really liked it.
I'm usually sceptic towards books like this but this one I can recommend.
