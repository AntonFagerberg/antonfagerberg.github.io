This book (in Swedish) is about the evacuation of Afghanistan in the wake of the US's desicion to leave and the taliban taking over.

It's hard to summarize since it covers a lot of different angles and people but overall it's about total chaos, bureaucracy, brave people and a totally different reality compared to the life I live.

I liked it a lot - heartwarming and gut wrenching.
