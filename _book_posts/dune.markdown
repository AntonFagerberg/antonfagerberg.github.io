This has been my "read in bed"-book, and it has taken over a year to finish it.
I know this is considered a classic / masterpiece and I can understand why - it
is a really good book.

It's hard to put my finger on what makes it so good but I think it's because it feels so
realistic. The language, characters and environment - it's almost like a history book.

As mentioned many times before, I'm no big fan of book series so let's see
if I'll pick up any of the other books.
