A Korean book which feels a bit similar to other Korean media, such as the movie
Parasite or the tv-show Squid Games, in that the main thread is the messed up side
of us humans. (It has kindness and hope as well, so it's not only misery!)

While it is good, it's not a book for me. I would've probably given up on it
if it weren't for the fact that it's really high paced and kinda short.

In the end though, I'm glad I finished it - but it's not one of my favorites or
a book I'll think back on.
