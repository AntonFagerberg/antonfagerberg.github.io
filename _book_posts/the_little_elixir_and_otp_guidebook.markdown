This is the perfect book for learning OTP if you already know a little bit of Elixir - or if you're mostly curious about learning OTP and not all the semantics of Elixir.

It will give you a short intro to Elixir, dive deeper into OTP behaviors, supervision, distribution, fault tolerance, load balancing and finish with exploring type specification, property based and concurrency testing.

It's easy to read, encouraging and on point. I liked it a lot.
