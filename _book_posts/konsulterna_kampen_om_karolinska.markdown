The story behind the new Swedish University Hospital Karolinska and how a bunch of consultants infiltrated it and messed it all up. An absolutely appalling story about how greed and pride caused suffering and death.

I think this book is a good book to read, if nothing else, just to be vary of what can happen if you're not cautious. Or simply if you just want to get angry.
