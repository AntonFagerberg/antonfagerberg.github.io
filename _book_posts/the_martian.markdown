I saw the movie adaptation when it came out and thought it was great. The book is very similar, so not as fun to read after seeing it, but it has more of the detailed good stuff so still worth it.

I like the very realistic story and scenarios, the snarky tongue-in-cheek cursing dialog / monolog of the main character and generally the feel of it.
