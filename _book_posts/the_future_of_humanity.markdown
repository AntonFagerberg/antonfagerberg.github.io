I've seen Michio Kaku on TV but never read any of his books (though I've owned another of his books for many years). The writing is very similar to his TV shows, it's cutting edge science mixed with probable science fiction.

For good and bad, the book contains a lot of interesting and cool things - which means it can be a bit overwhelming, it's so much stuff. The common thread through the book is a bit forced at times as well.
