I've been listening to the podcast with the same name recently and found it very entertaining. It's about professional handy-men telling funny stories about their weird customers (and themselves screwing up at times).

The book on the other hand is not nearly as funny and falls more into the trap of sounding condescending, especially in between stories when different customer stereotype are described.

Listen to the podcast but skip the book, unless you are professional handyman who want to vent out frustration, I guess...
