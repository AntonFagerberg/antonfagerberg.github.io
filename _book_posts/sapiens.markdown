This book is a masterpiece. It's about humanity, from taming fire to capitalism and everything in between and around. The author poignantly describes many of our human behaviors in an often thought provoking way.

It's hard to summarize this book, it's dense but insightful in a way that's hard for me to explain. Let's just say that it gave me a lot to thing about.
