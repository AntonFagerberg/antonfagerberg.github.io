As someone who grew up and loved the games from Id Software, this book have
been on my reading list for a long time. It was a great trip down memory lane to 
read about the development of games from Commander Keen to Quake.

The relationships and companies seems to have been more dysfunctional
than what I expected. Nonetheless, it's worth reading if you played their
games back in the days.
