This books was so damn good. I devoured it in a weekend, could not stop.
I read Andy's first book, The Martian, and liked it a lot. (I skipped Artemis, heard it was bad.) This book is in many ways similar to the Martian:
detailed realistic explainations (annoying at first), a witty main character but it's even more "out there". Deeper emotionally.

I want to talk about all the good parts but then I would spoil it. Just know it's good, good, good!
