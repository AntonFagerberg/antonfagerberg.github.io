This book (in Swedish about Sweden) was super interesting and a real eye-opener. It's about how the rich become even richer due to tax laws - unexpected for Sweden. It's about the insane market for houses and apartments. It's about greedy politicians. It's about bad decisions for the general population and tax payers.

This book was a really good and interesting read. It's humorous but at the same time really depressing to read.
