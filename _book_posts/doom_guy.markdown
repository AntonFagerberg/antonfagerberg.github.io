As someone who grew up playing Commander Keen and Quake, I had to read John Romero's autobiography.
Generally it's a really good and interesting book if you're curious about John and ID Software.

But, I have two problems with the book. First, if you've read Masters of Doom, then a lot of the content is very much the same. Almost to the degree that you can read about John's childhood and then skip to the very end. Secondly, and while John seems like a very nice guy, I can't shake that it feels very self promoting.
