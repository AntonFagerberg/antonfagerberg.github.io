This is an autobiography / minimalism tip book from The Minimalists; mostly by
Joshua Fields Millburn (also known from the Minimalism documentary).
Minimalism has a tendency to get almost religious and at
times this book can be a bit too much. But if you look beside that, this book
contains many golden nuggets of wisdom.
