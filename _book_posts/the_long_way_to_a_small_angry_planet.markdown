This was a great sci-fi story. It's character driven with a lot of likable
and detailed characters and cultures. The "main mission" is interesting but
it's somewhat in the background because there are so much other good stuff going
on. There's a certain warmth and humane feeling to the book that only a 
few authors pull off.

While I'm not a big fan of book series - in this case I will continue with the
next one for sure.
