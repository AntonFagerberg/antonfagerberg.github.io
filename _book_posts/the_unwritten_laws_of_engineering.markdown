Originally a 1944 classic about the unwritten "house rules" of the engineering profession (but now updated and revised a bit for the modern age). I didn't know at all what to expect but had to take a peek into this short book and I must say that it's a pretty solid book.

It's very short and on point (though some parts was a bit tedious) and has many good advices that holds up.
