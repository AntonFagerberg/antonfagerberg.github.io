Stanley Tucci is one of those actors I've probably seen in a lot of films but I can't mention a single one. I mainly picked up this book since it was a food-related biography and I like reading about food. It didn't disappoint at all.

The writing style is warm and witty (I liked it a lot). I learned a bit about Stanley and a lot about Italian food, drinks and restaurants. Recommended for everyone interested in food (you don't have to care about Stanley, or know who he is, to enjoy it).
