Kometen kommer (Comet in Moominland) is the second Moomin book in the series but the first one I've read. 

It's filled with wonderful whimsical characters but at the same time has an unnerving feeling about inevitable disaster (the book was written during the second world war).

Some pages contains beautiful illustrations by Tove herself which adds to the reading experience.
