Not sure why I picked up this book. I've never really seen anything by Amy but I guess this
was recommended to me at some point. The book is a really good read though.
It's a autobiography filled with a wonderful mix of comedy and tragedy.
Everything feels very real and Amy must be given credit for her ability to 
convey horrible things which has happened to her in a serious but at the same time
humorous way.
